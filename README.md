# Convo-AI
A simple, voice-activated chatbot built using Python, tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech capabilities. The chatbot allows users to interact via both text and speech, providing basic voice commands like opening websites (e.g., YouTube, Google) and responding to queries.
